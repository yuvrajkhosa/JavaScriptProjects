      Notice how long it takes for the last car in the jam to catch back up with traffic.
      It takes even longer than the first car in the jam takes to go all the way around.
      This is caused by human reaction time of taking time to slow down/speed up.
      Theoreticaly this problem can be diminished with self-driving cars as they have very small reaction times.
